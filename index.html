<h1>Water Quality in Manhattan</h1>  
<h1>Yeay! This is my first map using carto!</h1>


<p>Flint, Michigan is currently experiencing an environmental and health disaster after lead was found in the city's water system.
In NYC, lead had been a long time concern in paint and in the drinking water. Although NYC's water quality is considered to be
outstanding, the plumbing in households and businesses may contain traces of lead that can affect your health.</p>

<p>To act upon this the city created the Free Residential Lead Testing Program. Household owners receive the kit free of charge
for the Department of Environmental Protection to test the drinking water for high levels of lead.
Interested homeowners can request the kit by filling this form.</p> 

<p>With this in mind I decided to map<p>
  <p>1. Water quality complains to 311 (in blue)</p> 
  <p>2. Lead kits requested (in yellow).</p>

<p>The one thing that was the most obvious is that residents in the Upper West Side and Yorkville, 2 very afluent neighborhoods,
asked for the most kits when compared with the rest of the borough.</p>

<p>I will be ideal to also map the results of the tests, but was not able to find that piece of information.</p>
